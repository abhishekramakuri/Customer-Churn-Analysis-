# customer-churm-analysis

Customer churn analysis is the process of evaluating and understanding customer behavior to predict and mitigate customer churn. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or stop using its products or services. Understanding why customers churn is crucial for businesses, as it allows them to identify potential issues, make improvements, and implement strategies to retain customers.

This repository contains code and resources for performing customer churn analysis. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to approach churn analysis and develop models that can accurately predict customer churn. The analysis involves various steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and visualization of results.

# Key Features
# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models. The workflow demonstrates how raw customer data can be transformed into actionable insights for business decision-making.  

---

##  Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized raw data for consistency.  
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.  
- Transformed categorical and numerical variables to make them suitable for analysis.  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized and summarized key customer metrics.  
- Analyzed **churn rates**, **customer demographics**, and **usage patterns**.  
- Identified important trends and behaviors influencing churn.  

---

## Feature Engineering
- Created new features from existing data to enhance predictive performance.  
- Extracted meaningful attributes from transaction, usage, and demographic data.  
- Applied scaling and encoding to prepare features for modeling.  

---

## Model Training & Evaluation
- Implemented multiple machine learning models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forests  
  - Gradient Boosting  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
- Applied **cross-validation** to ensure model robustness and reliability.  

---

## Visualization
- Designed clear and interactive charts to communicate insights.  
- Illustrated churn distribution, feature importance, and model performance.  
- Used visual storytelling to make findings understandable to stakeholders.  

---

## Key Outcomes
- Built a reproducible pipeline for churn prediction.  
- Delivered insights into customer behavior and churn drivers.  
- Developed predictive models that can assist in **retention strategies**.
